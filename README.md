# RaspberryPi-Neopixel

WORK IN PROGRESS

Neopixel (WS2812b) LED-Strip controlled with Raspberry Pi

The purpose of this (school-)project is to gain experience with the Raspberry Pi and how to use it to control various things.
In this case a WS2812b LED-Strip will be controlled.

This project has a 2-part goal:

Part 1:
-Basic function, getting the Pi to work with the strip
-Interaction, controlling the strip through an input, specifically moving a single LED (planned: increasing/decreasing a scale) across the strip using two buttons

Part 2:
-Syncing the strip to music (not implemented yet)

Requirements:
-Raspberry Pi (This project uses the Raspberry Pi 4 Modell B)
-WS2812b LED-Strip
-Powersupply
-Logic Level shifter (74ABT125N Level Shifter used)
-Buttons x 2
-Breadboard
-Jumpercable (Male-Male & Male-Female)

Part 1:
Basic function
